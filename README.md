# Bukkure
Integrating Bukkit and Clojure for heaveanly delight.
[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/bukkure/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/bukkure)

## Getting started
To start, you will need a build of Spigot. The official instructions to get Spigot is [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/).
However, you can download the jar from [md-5's CI](http://ci.md-5.net/job/Spigot/) instead of building.

You should start spigot once, to create required folders & files (e.g. the plugins directory)

## Plugin Development
There is a bukkure plugin template available, but it is still in snapshot, to get it use:
`lein new bukkure my-awesome-plugin --snapshot`

## REPL
Use [bukkurerepl](https://github.com/SevereOverfl0w/bukkurerepl)

## API
The api is completely undocumented at this time, the best way to find out the api methods at this time is by diving into the source.
